As a result, by-laws will always have to conform to the planning legislation first and foremost. The Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage or your local government can provide advice regarding the most recent legislative requirements.\\n\\nWhile a strata company does not need legislative authority to do short-term rentals, they might choose to set their own by-laws for short-term rentals in their complex. The standard by-laws currently included in the Strata Titles (General) Regulations 2019 don’t include short-term rentals, so an owner can do short-term rentals unless another law prohibits or restricts them from doing so.\\n\\nA short-stay accommodation by-law would fall into the category of a governance by-law, which would require the strata company to make a resolution without dissent to bring them into effect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPet by-laws\\n\\nThe Act provides that a by-law is invalid if it prohibits or restricts the keeping on the lot of an animal that is used as an assistance animal by a person with a disability who is an owner or occupier of a lot.\\n\\nThe Act provides that an assistance animal has the meaning given in section 9(2) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Commonwealth). The Act further provides that a by-law is invalid if it prohibits or restricts the use on the parcel (the land in the scheme) of an assistance animal by a person with a disability.\\n\\nApart from the above prohibitions and restrictions in the Act, if the conduct by-laws in Schedule 2 of the Act apply to the scheme (conduct by-law 12(c)), an owner or occupier of a lot must not keep animals on the lot or common\\n\\nproperty after notice is given to such person by the council. The implication in this by-law is that animals can be kept on the lot or common property until further notice is given not to.\\n\\nA strata company can make different by-laws for the scheme concerning the keeping of pets. Any by-law made in relation to pets could be challenged if it could be argued that it is unfairly prejudicial or discriminatory against one or more lot owners, or oppressive or unreasonable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVehicle parking by-law\\n\\nConduct by-law 1(1) in Schedule 2 of the Act provides that an owner or occupier of a lot must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the owner’s or occupier’s visitors comply with the scheme by-laws relating to parking of motor vehicles. Conduct by-law 1(2) then provides that an owner or occupier of a lot must not park or stand any motor or other vehicle on common property, except with the written approval of the strata company.\\n\\nA strata company may make vehicle and parking by-laws different to the conduct by-laws in Schedule 1 of the Act. Again, any such by-law should not be unfairly prejudicial, discriminatory, oppressive or unreasonable.\\n\\nA strata company may enter into a contract or arrangement with a local government to enforce laws relating to roads on the parcel and enforcement of local laws.\\n\\n\\n\\n', metadata={'URL':
